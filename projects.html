                    	    <h3>July 2024 - Present</h3>
                        <p>A remake the JavaFX based Target Tag game.  This version is made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript with an emphasis on using the HTML Canvas.  Although not exact to the original, this version 
                            can be played on any device thanks to its mobile controls and browser based format.  As for the tractors, they were the only images I had on hand while desinging the game.  This game is still very 
                            much a work in progress and is here for TEST PURPOSES ONLY.  There are several bugs and UI issues that would need to be fixed before it could be considerd fully playable.

                        <h3>February 2024 - May 2024</h3>
                        <p>Made as part of my course IS360, Splash Dash was my first intro into game development using the Unity Game Engine.  As the course progresses, however, I got a little carried away.  
                            At the time of it's "completion" Splash Dash included an array of features including character selection, level selection, and mobile UI controls.  The game featured voice actors for 
                            each character and was completly hand-drawn and then scanned into Paint3D using a scanner to give the characters a classic cartoon feel.  Each character is animated as well.  The game was made to 
                            help raise awarness of the growing problem of pollution.  Playing as an array of different sea creatures the player must collect as much trash as possible before time runs out!  <a href="">  More Info page coming soon</a>

                    	    <h3>November 2023 - December 2023</h3>
                        <p>This was my first ever made from scratch, large, programming project.  It was made as a collaboration with two other students, but it went far beyong the 
                            requirments of the course project.  Target Tag is a JavaFX based game incorporating many features including a computer controlled opponent and randomly moving obstacles.  
                            The game features several modes for difficulty adjustments and co-op modes.  The goal of the game was to collect 20 randomly spawning targets before your opponents.  
                            Unfortunantly JavaFX cannot easily be ran in a browser, so this game is only playable through an IDE.  I will hopefully be able to include a downloadable release for the game someday.</p>
