                        <h2>Splash Dash</h2>
                        <p>Made as part of my course IS360, Splash Dash was my first intro into game development using the Unity Game Engine.  As the course progresses, however, I got a little carried away.  
                            At the time of it's "completion" Splash Dash included an array of features including character selection, level selection, and mobile UI controls.  The game featured voice actors for 
                            each character and was completly hand-drawn and then scanned into Paint3D using a scanner to give the characters a classic cartoon feel.  Each character is animated as well.  The game was made to 
                            help raise awarness of the growing problem of pollution.  Playing as an array of different sea creatures the player must collect as much trash as possible before time runs out!

                        <h2>Target Tag</h2>
                        <p>This was my first ever made from scratch, large, programming project.  It was made as a collaboration with two other students, but it went far beyong the 
                            requirments of the course project.  Target Tag is a JavaFX based game incorporating many features including a computer controlled opponent and randomly moving obstacles.  
                            The game features several modes for difficulty adjustments and co-op modes.  Unfortunantly JavaFX cannot easily be ran in a browser right now, 
                            so this game is only playable through an IDE.  I will hopefully be able to include a downloadable release for the game someday.</p>

                            with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  It was never finished, but I do hope to possibly turn it into an eccomerce site someday.
